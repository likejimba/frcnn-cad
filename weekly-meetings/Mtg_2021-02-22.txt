Weekly meeting, week of 2/22/2021
Updates:


1. Admin
a.	GitHub for agenda, images, phantoms
b.	Project timeline, replacement

2. Phantom printing
a.	Epson printer: Print with KI - results in progress
b.	Roland printer: Use Tyrion purple - ordered

3. Virtual Lesion pipeline
a.	Mass classes: spiculated and lobular
b.	Worked with Kenny on fixing bounding box size; numerous issues

4. Observer Study
a.  Large and small MC clusters: 10 mm and 20 mm, same # calcs so density different.
b.  Pilot study with 2 tasks: detection and classfn. 2AFC observer picks which is smaller/larger, start w FFDM. 



To Do:
2. a. Check that the I0 is not changing from shot to shot. Should be the same
3. a. Use scientific computer to access virutal models from g-drive, onto network
3. b. Need to visualize/display images of masses in phantom
3. c. See if CAD gives higher scores for spiculated, could serve as evidence for features we took. Even if CAD doesn't distinguish, can do observer study form bases for classf'n task
