Weekly meeting, week of 3/03/2021
Updates:

## 1. Phantom printing
a.	Epson printer: Print with KI - successful with grayscale and RGB; Check that the I0 is not changing from shot to shot. Should be the same
b.	Roland printer: Use Tyrion purple - mixed with yellow eco-sol ink

# To Do:
If tyrian purple not soluble, consider using regular ink in Roland Printer

## 2. Virtual Lesion pipeline
a.	Mass classes: spiculated and lobular
b.	Visualize/display images of masses in phantom

# To Do:
Look at lobular results, using same density of 1.56
Compare difference in average CAD scores
For pilot study, use default density of 1.06, to make it difficult

## 3. Observer Study
a.  Large and small MC clusters: 10 mm and 20 mm, roughly same density so number of visible specks is the same.
b.  MC Pilot study with classf'n task. Might have to make additional templates as we see tradeoff between maintaining number of specks vs density of specks. 
c.  To increase difficulty, maybe add PMMA on top of phantom to increase noise, decrease contrast. 
d.  If fewer than ~5 specks in cluster, may be ignored. Important to distinguish number of specks in cluster then
