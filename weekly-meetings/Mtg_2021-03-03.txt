Weekly meeting, week of 2/22/2021
Updates:


1. Phantom printing
a.	Epson printer: Print with KI - successful with grayscale and RGB; Check that the I0 is not changing from shot to shot. Should be the same
b.	Roland printer: Use Tyrion purple - mixed with yellow eco-sol ink

To Do:
If tyrian purple not soluble, consider using regular ink in Roland Printer

2. Virtual Lesion pipeline
a.	Mass classes: spiculated and lobular
b.	Visualize/display images of masses in phantom

To Do:
Look at lobular results, using same density of 1.56
Compare difference in average CAD scores
For pilot study, use default density of 1.06, to make it difficult

3. Observer Study
a.  Large and small MC clusters: 10 mm and 20 mm, same # calcs so density different.
b.  Pilot study with 2 tasks: detection and classfn. 2AFC observer picks which is smaller/larger, start w FFDM.
c. See if CAD gives higher scores for spiculated, could serve as evidence for features we took. Even if CAD doesn't distinguish, can do observer study form bases for classf'n task



To Do:
