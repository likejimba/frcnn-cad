# Week of 3/03/2021
Updates:

## 1. Phantom printing
a.	Epson printer: Print with KI - successful with grayscale and RGB; Check that the I0 is not changing from shot to shot. Should be the same
b.	Roland printer: Use Tyrion purple - mixed with yellow eco-sol ink
### To Do:
If tyrian purple not soluble, consider using regular ink in Roland Printer

## 2. Virtual Lesion pipeline
a.	Mass classes: spiculated and lobular
b.	Visualize/display images of masses in phantom
### To Do:
Look at lobular results, using same density of 1.56
Compare difference in average CAD scores
For pilot study, use default density of 1.06, to make it difficult

## 3. Observer Study
a.  Large and small MC clusters: 10 mm and 20 mm, roughly same density so number of visible specks is the same.
b.  MC Pilot study with classf'n task. Might have to make additional templates as we see tradeoff between maintaining number of specks vs density of specks. 
c.  To increase difficulty, maybe add PMMA on top of phantom to increase noise, decrease contrast. 
d.  If fewer than ~5 specks in cluster, may be ignored. Important to distinguish number of specks in cluster then

Updates:


## 1. Admin
a.	GitHub for agenda, images, phantoms
b.	Project timeline, replacement

## 2. Phantom printing
a.	Epson printer: Print with KI - results in progress
b.	Roland printer: Use Tyrion purple - ordered

## 3. Virtual Lesion pipeline
a.	Mass classes: spiculated and lobular
b.	Worked with Kenny on fixing bounding box size; numerous issues

## 4. Observer Study
a.  Large and small MC clusters: 10 mm and 20 mm, same # calcs so density different.
b.  Pilot study with 2 tasks: detection and classfn. 2AFC observer picks which is smaller/larger, start w FFDM. 

### To Do:
2. a. Check that the I0 is not changing from shot to shot. Should be the same
3. a. Use scientific computer to access virutal models from g-drive, onto network
3. b. Need to visualize/display images of masses in phantom
3. c. See if CAD gives higher scores for spiculated, could serve as evidence for features we took. Even if CAD doesn't distinguish, can do observer study form bases for classf'n task
